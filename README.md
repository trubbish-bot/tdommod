# tdommod
A Balatro mod which retextures all 22 Tarot cards.

Each tarot card's number has been replaced by a letter count in brackets. You'll have to play some runs to find the number that corresponds to each tarot card!

(Modding Balatro is a little spooky the first time. If you're not confident, maybe find someone who's modded Balatro in the past.)
